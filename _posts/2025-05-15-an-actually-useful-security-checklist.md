This checklist is a personal reference tool for me, as well as a useful tool if you got a penetration test report saying vague stuff like "secure configuration" and "hardening" and you want to actually find out what to type into your keyboard.

Unless otherwise stated, most of the configuration changes below will require you to reload or restart the service to fully apply them.

### üìå Disable Insecure Ciphers

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/ssh/sshd_config

MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,umac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com
KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
```

### üìå Disable Root Login

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

```console
(editor) /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PermitRootLogin no
```

</details>

### üìå Enforce Strong Passwords

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

You can enforce strong SSH passwords using PAM.

First, install the PAM package:

```console
apt install libpam-pwquality
```

Then enable PAM in the SSH configuration file:

```console
(editor) /etc/ssh/sshd_config

UsePAM yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Then set your password requirements in the PAM configuration file:

```console
(editor) /etc/pam.d/common-password

password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen={minimum length} ucredit=-{number of uppercase letters} lcredit=-{number of lowercase letters} dcredit=-{number of digits} ocredit=-{number of special characters}
```

Make sure the settings also match in this configuration file:

```console
(editor) /etc/security/pwquality.conf

minlen = {minimum length}
ucredit = -{number of uppercase letters}
lcredit = -{number of lowercase letters}
dcredit = -{number of digits}
ocredit = -{number of special characters}
```

You can also block common passwords like this:

```console
(editor) /etc/pam.d/common-password

password requisite ... dictcheck=1 (add to the end of the existing line)
```

```console
(editor) /etc/security/pwquality.conf

dictcheck = 1
dictpath = /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small (or a custom wordlist you made)
```

Some recommended "bad passwords" to block if you make a custom wordlist are:

```console
1234
123456
admin
letmein
password
qwerty
```

{: .box-success}
‚úÖ **Verification**: Change a user's password with passwd (sudo passwd {user}) and verify that you can't set a password that does not conform to the configured requirements.

</details>

### üìå Whitelist Access

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

The OpenSSH service should only be accessible to a limited range of IP addresses, ideally off a whitelist that is enforced by the local firewall and/or by the OpenSSH service configuration file. You can use the `AllowUsers` and `AllowGroups` directives to make access as granular as possible.

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Match Address {ip,ip,ip...}
    AllowUsers {user} {user} {user}...
```

</details>

# üåé Web (HTTP/HTTPS) Services

---

## üåé Apache HTTP

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

{: .box-note}
*Package Name(s): **apache2** (apt), **httpd** (yum)*<br>*Common Port(s): <strong>80</strong> (HTTP), <strong>443</strong> (HTTPS), <strong>8080</strong> (Alternate HTTP), <strong>8443</strong> (Alternate HTTPS)*

Unless otherwise stated, most of the Apache configuration changes below will require you to reload or restart Apache to fully apply them, i.e.:

```console
service apache2 restart

systemctl restart apache2
```

File locations may also vary depending on how you set up your web server.

### üìå Disable SSLv2/SSLv3/TLSv1/TLSv1.1

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/(ssl config file)

SSLProtocol all -SSLv3 -SSLv2 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
```

</details>

### üìå Disable TRACE

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf

TraceEnable Off
```

{: .box-success}
‚úÖ **Verification**: Use nmap with the <a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html">http-methods</a> script to scan open HTTP/HTTPS ports (usually 80/443) and verify that the TRACE method doesn't appear in the list of supported methods.

</details>

### üìå Enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>
The maximum age value can vary depending on your preferences, but the default value of 31536000 I usually use has never caused any issues.

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/(config files)

Header always set Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000
```

{: .box-success}
‚úÖ **Verification**: Browse to the site and verify that you receive a Strict-Transport-Security header in the HTTP response, and that it has the configured age value. You can see it using your web browser's Developer Tools (Network -> Headers), or through nmap and other header grabber tools.

</details>

### üìå Hide Server Information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf

ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod
```

{: .box-success}
‚úÖ **Verification**: Use nmap with the service detection flag (`-sV`) to scan open HTTP/HTTPS ports (usually 80/443) and verify that the banner grab shows "Apache" instead of "Apache x.x.x".

</details>

### üìå Remove Unnecessary Files/Directories

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>
Remove or conceal the following directories and files from `/var/www/html` (or whichever file location is tied to your web server setup):
- `.config`
- `.env` (can leak hardcoded secrets)
- `.git` (can leak hardcoded secrets)
- `.gitattributes`
- `.github`
- `.gitignore`
- `.gitinfo`
- `.viminfo`
- `phpinfo` (can expose PHP version information)
- `phpinfo.php` (can expose PHP version information)

If desired, you can entirely block specific sensitive file types from being browsed in `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf` (or wherever your Apache configuration files are):

```console
RedirectMatch 404 /\.git
RedirectMatch 404 /\.svn
```

{: .box-success}
‚úÖ **Verification**: Browse to these directories and files in any web browser and verify that you receive either a 403 Forbidden or a 404 Not Found response. You can also use curl.

</details>

### üìå <span class='highlight'>mod_status</span>: Restrict Access To Server Status Page

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

```console
(editor) /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf

<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Require local
    Require ip {ip ip ip...}
</Location>
```

</details>

## üåé Apache Tomcat

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

{: .box-note}
*Common Port(s): **80** (HTTP), **443** (HTTPS), **8080** (Alternate HTTP), **8443** (Alternate HTTPS)*

Unless otherwise stated, you will usually have to run the Tomcat shutdown and startup scripts (or restart the service if it's configured as one) to fully apply these changes.

`$CATALINA_HOME` on most installations is something like `/home/tomcat/` or `/opt/tomcat/` (Debian/Ubuntu). If you need to manually tell the server where it is, you can do it like this:

```console
export CATALINA_HOME={directory}
```

### üìå Restrict Access To Manager Application

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Expand...</summary>

The `context.xml` file controls access to the Manager Application that comes bundled with Tomcat. You will usually want to restrict this to only localhost access (127.0.0.1).

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

```console
(editor) $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
           allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1" />
</Context>
```

If you want to also allow a specific IP address, i.e. **[1].[2].[3].[4]**, format it like **[1]\\.[2]\\.[3]\\.[4]** and add it to the allow statement with an "or" operator (`|`).
